The purpose of this pogram is to create a calculator that can process complex expressions and calculate the answers to said problems.
The most important variables used in this program were the "try" and "except" variables.
I learned about these variables earlier in class and determined that they would be useful for completing this assignment.
The "try" variable allows a given process to be tested by the program for any error, and the "except" varaible accounts for that error.
By using these in my program, I could account for any potential errors in my program and print an appropriate message.
That way I could validate all of my expressions to make sure their values were appropriate.
When combined with the general design of the program, this allows for it to calculate simple and complex mathematical expressions.
These expressions are input by the user, and if they are input incorrectly an appropriate error message is produced.
Regarding problems, I have encountered difficulties utilizing the "last" command within the program.
Specifically, I have been unable to identify any way to print an entire history of past results due to said history not being saved within Python.
